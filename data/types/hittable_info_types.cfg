	Material sounds are currently used for two things - sounds when the player 'footfalls' onto the ground, and sounds when a thrown object collides with the ground.
	
	These two sets of sounds are mutually exclusive, despite being intermingled into one set; sounds for being a thrown object typically don't have anything for footfalls, and vice-versa.  Because of how they're currently coded, they just roll a match and fall back to the default if a sound isn't present, but this can be changed, later.

	The first set of sounds here is projectiles, the second set is footfalls.
