		if we're going after a static point, we can safely use static values for our target-acquisition; if we're seeking a moving target, though, we'll run a serious risk of never really catching up to it.  The heuristics here are really a question of what the whole gameplay challenge for these objects is - one of the original things this prototype was developed for was the gazerlets on the gazer_boss; they're meant to get 'reasonably close' to the player and explode.  If we don't give a substantial amount of 'grace' to the "I've reached it" determination, these objects would get close enough to bump the player, constantly, but never actually decide they're close enough to 'detonate'.
		
		Massaging these heuristics is probably going to remain one of the messier bits of work in this prototype, whenever any new 'use case' for the prototype gets added.
