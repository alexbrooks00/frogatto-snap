	This prototype is for objects that are toggles/levers/buttons/etc.   The key difference between this and the prototype used by most of these is that this does NOT do any of the actual event-toggling/tracking, or camera movement.  This contains all the code necessary to handle flipping a switch, but defers the behavior for actually tracking it to a more sophisticated prototype that inherits from it.
	
	The rationale here is that although many switches are self-contained, some switches are essentially "compound" objects;  you're flipping multiple switches to trigger a single gate or somesuch.  In such a case, all of the flipping behavior and graphics and such are the same.  However, the logic for actually toggling the event and handling the camera must exist in only the "coordinator" object.
