**Frogatto & Friends** is an action-adventure game, starring a certain quixotic frog.  We're trying to push 2D platforming, pixel-art, and music into uncharted territory; we hope you like the results!

See the [Downloads page](http://www.frogatto.com/download) on our website for ready to use packages for your platform, or check [INSTALL](/INSTALL) for instructions on building from source.

The game's source code license can be found in the [LICENSE](/LICENSE) file in the distribution.

### Engine
Frogatto is driven by [Anura](https://github.com/anura-engine/anura), a very flexible, high-performance 2d game engine we've developed - it's suitable for almost any 2D videogame, and has a few special features for pixel-art and graphical-effects commonly seen in pixel-art titles.  It has already been used to ship another complete game, called [Cube Trains](https://ddr0.ca/cube%20trains/index), and several others are in the works (e.g. [Argentum Age](https://github.com/davewx7/citadel)).

This repository houses the Frogatto module for the Anura engine, but versions 1.3.1 of Frogatto and prior contain the engine as well and are incompatible with the Anura repository.
